# Proposal

## Overview

Elderlies safe chronic health conditions,
 
In this project we build a robot that helps elderlies to communicate with their families via video call *Skype* . The caller can dial to the person, the robot gets the video call then smartly navigate inside the nursing home to the target. Additionally, the caller can remotly control the robot.

## Interest and complexity


## Showcase proposal
The final prototype includes two robots, each combines its camera (for navigation) and the tablets (for receiving video calls). Additionally, we will have the phone application for controlling both robots remotely and making the video call.
We have the functionality for controlling two robots which means it can be extended accordingly.  .  

## Cloud integration
In this project we will use the firebase:
1) Elderlies and their families (users) information in the SQL database. 
2) We will use the firebase for video streaming. 
3) 4 variables for controlling the robot remotely (right,left,backward,forward).

## User-end
TBD: Describe here the application side.

## Equipment Needed
- Hover wheels and its 3d printed parts.
- 4X Drivers: DC 12-36V 500W Brushless Motor PWM Control Controller.
- TBD: Camera for navigation. 
- TBD: Microcontrollers, Arduino for basic controlling.
